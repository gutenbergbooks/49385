<p>I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Humphreys, Mr. John Murray, and the
Editor of the <i>Spectator</i> for kind permission to reproduce a few of
the shorter poems in this tale of Persian mystics. I have included
them, firstly, because I wished otherwise new work, being a memorial,
to include such fragments of the past as might be worth preserving;
secondly, because decreasing leisure inspires a diffidence in the
future that may justify me in asking a reader or a friend to judge or
remember me only by "Foolery" and "The Singing Caravan."</p>

<div class="verse">The sun smote Elburz like a gong.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Slow down the mountain's molten face</div>
<div class="verse">Zigzagged the caravan of song.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Time was its slave and went its pace.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It bore a white Transcaspian Queen</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Whose barque had touched at Enzelí.</div>
<div class="verse">Splendid in jewelled palanquin</div>
<div class="verse indent2">She cleft Iran from sea to sea,</div>

<div class="verse">Bound for the Persian Gulf of Pearls,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Where demons sail for drifting isles</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For passports. Thus the caravan,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Singing from chief to <i>charvadar</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">Reached the great gate of screened Tehran.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Swarmed thick to see the vision pass</div>
<div class="verse indent2">On broidered camels like a fleet</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They called him Dreamer-of-the-Age,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The least of Allah's <i>Muslimeen</i></div>
<div class="verse">Who knew the joys of pilgrimage</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And wore the sign of sacred green,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A poet, poor and wistful-eyed.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Him all the beauty and the song</div>
<div class="verse">Drew by swift magic to her side,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Past friends who questioned of his goal:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">"The Brazen Cliffs? The Realms of Musk?</div>
<div class="verse">Goes he to Mecca for his soul?..."</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The town-light dwindled in the dusk</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Behind. Ahead Misr? El Katíf?</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The moon far up a brine-green sky</div>
<div class="verse">Made Demavend a huge pale reef</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Set in an ocean long gone dry.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bleached mosques like dwarf cave-stalagmites,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Smooth silver-bouldered <i>biyaban</i></div>
<div class="verse">And sevenfold velvet of white nights</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Vied with the singing caravan</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To make her pathway plain.</div>
<div class="verse indent22">Then one</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Beside the poet murmured low:</div>
<div class="verse">"I plod behind, sun after sun,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">O master, whither do we go?</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Are we for some palmed port of Fars,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or tombed Kerbela, or Baghdad</div>
<div class="verse">The Town-of-Knowledge-of-the-Stars?</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Is worship wise or are we mad?"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Answered the poet: "Do we ask</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Allah to buy each Friday's throng?</div>
<div class="verse">None to whom worship is a task</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Should join the caravan of song.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"With heart and eyes unquestioning, friend,</div>

<div class="verse">And Love and Prayer have common end:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">'May God be merciful to me!'"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So fared they, camped from noon to even,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Till dawn, quick-groping through the gloom,</div>
<div class="verse">Pounced on gilt planets low in heaven.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thus they beheld the domes of Kum.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And onward nightly. Though the dust</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Swirled in dread shapes of desert <i>Jinn</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever the footsore poet's trust</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Soared to the jewelled palanquin,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Parched, but still singing: "God, being great,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">He holds it high, and signs to me</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

<div class="verse indent2">He saw not where the other died,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But pressed on strongly, loth to halt</div>
<div class="verse indent2">At Persia's pride, Rose-Ispahan,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose hawks are bathed in pure cobalt.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To meet the singing caravan</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Came henna-bearded prince and sage</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With henna-fingered <i>houris</i>, who</div>
<div class="verse">Strove to retard the pilgrimage,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"A poet. Sing of us instead.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He said: "I seek a bliss beyond</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Because I bargain not nor guess</div>

<div class="verse">Serdar-i-Jang, the Wazir of the west,</div>
<div class="verse">Of all mankind had served his country best</div>
<div class="verse">By weeding it. The terror of his name</div>
<div class="verse">Lapped up the barren Pusht-i-kuh like flame,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the Shah smiled: "My other lords of war lose</div>

THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So to the journey's end. The Gulf was there</div>
<div class="verse">Steaming and soundless, and the weary feet</div>
<div class="verse">Were stayed at last from following the Queen.</div>
<div class="verse">The great <i>dhow</i> nosed the creek; slow water lapped</div>
<div class="verse">About her burnished; burnished in her sat</div>
<div class="verse">Unmoving bronze, her oarsmen. Then they rose:</div>
<div class="verse">"Hail, Bringers of the Queen!" "Hail, ship! you bear</div>
<div class="verse">What cargo hence?" "We carry on your charge."</div>
<div class="verse">"But leave us nothing&mdash;nothing in exchange?"</div>
<div class="verse">"Only the ancient story of a slave.</div>
<div class="verse">There lies a secret buried none too deep."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus the chief rower. This the far-off tale.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I dwelled beside the impulsive Rhone, a child that loved to be alone.</div>
<div class="verse">The forest was my nursery. My happiness was all my own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I knew by name each cloud that lowers the sunshine through in liquid showers.</div>
<div class="verse">Deep in the tangled undergrowth I caught the singing of the flowers.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Our minstrels sang of rape and arson, all the joys of private wars.</div>
<div class="verse">The forest wall was calm and tall. My tutor laughed, and drank to Mars.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bald, vulture-like upon its perch, our crag-born castle seemed to search</div>
<div class="verse">The gorge for prey, its shade to still the bells a-twitter in the church</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Where, cheek by jowl with fearsome fowl and gargoyle, ghostly men, in foul</div>
<div class="verse">Incense that tried to stifle me, recited magic formulæ.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At home clanked metal psalm and spur; but, oh the woods ...! I tried to tame</div>
<div class="verse">A wolf-cub that the gardener called Life. He knew. The preacher came.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I see him yet, his visage wet with hot emotion, tears, and sweat.</div>
<div class="verse">Contorted in the market-place he shrieked that all must pay a debt</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To one Jehovah and His Son, by bursting eastward as the Hun</div>
<div class="verse">Had scourged the West. In unison we all replied 'twere nobly done,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For he explained that heaven was gained more featly&mdash;wrenching Saint Jerome&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">From Palestine than Christendom. That night no peasant durst go home.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His words were like a wind that fanned a grass-fire: God would lend His hand</div>
<div class="verse">To purge away the infidel whose breath profaned the Holy Land.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He showered indulgences, and kissed the brows of those who would enlist</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">No wonder that our heartstrings glowed within us like a smelted lode</div>
<div class="verse">Whence Kobolds welded Durandal; and like one man we ran or rode</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Forth. Were we not enchanted? This was first among God's certainties.</div>
<div class="verse">Even our steeds were like Shabdíz, the pride of King Khusraw Parvíz.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We saw our path made plain, the hills removed by faith, whose foaming course</div>
<div class="verse">Flooded the continents like flats. We saw the world made one&mdash;by force.</div>

<div class="verse">In ecstasy our spirits soared. With beatific face toward</div>
<div class="verse">My cloudland all the crowd shed tears, and vowed to serve and save the Lord.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But cloudland, seeming to disdain such warmth, replied with slapping rain.</div>
<div class="verse">Conjuring such black augury the monks recited formulæ.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Besides, lest women, priests and traders should tempt the appetite of raiders,</div>
<div class="verse">The Church proclaimed the Truce of God. Not all our barons were crusaders.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Those who were frightened not to go sold all they had to make a show,</div>
<div class="verse">Land, tool and ware to pay a fare. The panic made sly kings its heir.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So much was sold by young and old, by fond, ambitious, hot and cold,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In such a gust my tender age availed not with the preaching sage,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Though I was loth to go, and prayed for mercy and a little maid</div>
<div class="verse">Whose hair was shining sunflower brown. I thought of all the games we played</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All day with hay and idle mowers. She dubbed me knight in pixy bowers,</div>

<div class="verse">His pagan books. The fever would abate, he sneered, when we were bled.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He chilled me. His head was like a block of ice, so clear. He tried to shock</div>
<div class="verse">Me with his whispered flings that saints and monarchs came of laughing-stock,</div>

<div class="verse">Nor that I <i>loved</i> the birchwood's skin, the pansy's face, the sheep-dog's grin,</div>
<div class="verse">That sleep with Nature in a field was sweet to me as mortal sin.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I stroked the landscape like a lute. No scentless words, no colours mute,</div>
<div class="verse">Could paint its music. Henceforth I had only heaven for substitute.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sling, crossbow, bludgeon, axe and spud, cilice and vials of sacred blood,</div>
<div class="verse">On such equipment we relied. Our foes were misery and mud.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Each Norman keep, each Frankish hold, each corner of the Christian fold</div>
<div class="verse">Sent forth its sheep to sound of bells. Our prophets might have had them tolled.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Prince, abbot, squire, felt the desire of bliss that swept stews, taverns, farms.</div>
<div class="verse">Soft damosels ploughed through the mire with babe at breast and men-at-arms;</div>

<div class="verse">And, since this journey was the price of entrance into Paradise,</div>
<div class="verse">The gaols belched out their criminals and beggars all alive with lice.</div>

<div class="verse">We took no food, for God is good; besides we heard that convents strewed</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Heading the mass far up the pass, that led us straight to Calvary,</div>
<div class="verse">The preaching-man upon an ass recited magic formulæ.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Soon we were joined by northern lords; no few among their folk had swords.</div>
<div class="verse">(Walter the Pennyless his rout had gone before and died in hordes,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Our force could not await the Turk, but in its ardour got to work</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
